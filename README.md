## Introduction 

Ethical systems can be complex and multifaceted, shaped by diverse factors like history, culture, and personal beliefs. It is a continuous process that involves reflection and evaluation of choices when confronted with moral dilemmas, both on an individual and societal level. As algorithms and AI technologies become increasingly pervasive in our lives, ethical considerations are crucial to ensure their responsible and beneficial integration. This essay aims to address different facets of building and implementing AI models. At each step of the way, a wide range of underlying ethical conundrums bubble to the surface, and an effort has been made to highlight solutions that, while imperfect, are attentive to our current needs.
